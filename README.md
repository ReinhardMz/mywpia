stuff with WPIA

Currently I am president of WPIA which is a non for profit and charitable association located in Graz, Austria.
Our mission includes the creation and operation of a Trusted Service Provider to deploy digital electronic certificates to the public for free.
To get this job well done we must pass an audit to enter the truststores of browsers and OS distributors.
We started that audit following the rules as laid out in EN ETSI 19 411-1. Our auditor is the german TÃœV organisation.

If You want to support our project please write an email to info@wpia.club.

I will update this repository with information about our project from time to time.

Kind regards
Reinhard Mutz
